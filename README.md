## Installation

1. To run the projects, you'll need to have Java installed on your machine. You can download Java from the [official website](https://www.java.com/en/download/).

2. (Optional) Install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Visual Studio Code.

   - To install IntelliJ IDEA, follow the instructions on the [official website](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
  
   - To install Visual Studio Code, follow the instructions on the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).


## Usage

1. To use the projects in this repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

    `git clone https://github.com/aamirxshaikh/java.git`

2. After you've cloned the repository to your local machine, you can either open the project directory in your preferred IDE or use a text editor to edit the code. Then, execute the following commands to run the project.

    ```
    javac Main.java
    java Main
    ```

    This will compile and run the project's Main class. Each project is self-contained and can be run independently.

3. Alternatively, if you're using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Visual Studio Code, you can simply open the project in the IDE and run the program by clicking the "run" icon.
