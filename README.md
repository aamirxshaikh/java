Each project is self-contained and can be run independently.

## Getting Started

To run the projects, you'll need to have Java installed on your machine. You can download Java from the [official website](https://www.java.com/en/download/).

Once you have Java installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/aamirxshaikh/java.git`


Each project has its own directory and contains a `Main` class that you can run to execute the program. For example, to run the `HelloWorld` program, navigate to the `HelloWorld` directory and run the following command:

```
javac Main.java
java Main
```
